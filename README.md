<p></p>We have developed an open offline cryptocurrency wallet that meticulously demonstrates every detail of wallet creation and transaction initiation, ensuring you fully understand and control each step. Yes, having complete control yourself guarantees foolproof security! No reliance on cryptocurrency trading platforms—where your private keys are exposed—nor on existing cryptocurrency wallets, which obscure details and may contain backdoors.</p>

<p>Our offline cryptocurrency wallet is fully open-source, with transparent and publicly available code. Everyone can inspect the source code, so you can use it with complete confidence.</p>

<h1>How to Use the Open Offline Wallet?</h1>
<p></p>There are multiple methods.</p>

<p>Method 1: Browser https://www.walletoffline.com/btceth/ to open the offline wallet site. You can familiarize yourself with the demo operations there, but it is not recommended for actual use.</p>

<p>Method 2: Browser https://www.walletoffline.com/btceth/ to open the offline wallet site, then switch your browser to offline mode or physically disconnect from the internet. This makes it safer for actual use, as private keys cannot be leaked online.</p>

<p>Method 3: Download the offline wallet to your local hard drive. You can then open the page offline to perform wallet and transaction operations securely.</p>
